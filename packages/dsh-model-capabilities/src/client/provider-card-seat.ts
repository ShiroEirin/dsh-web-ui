/**
 * The Models page's provider-card seat claim for the pi-ai adapter family.
 *
 * `settings.models.provider-card` is a KEYED slot: the Models page dispatches
 * one extension area per provider settings namespace, and a cell renders
 * exactly one entry. The core registry refuses a second registration into an
 * occupied cell (same key, same priority) by throwing — the right default, but
 * it makes the loser of a collision silently invisible unless it reports the
 * refusal. Two unrelated plugins that both extend pi-ai provider cards (this
 * one and a third-party auth plugin, for example) therefore cannot both
 * render, and the reporter must be able to see that.
 *
 * This module owns that outcome so it is never a silent blank:
 *
 * - a refused claim is classified and reported (console plus a status the
 *   Models page renders), naming the registrant that holds the cell;
 * - the claim is retried on every change to that slot, so disabling the
 *   occupying plugin restores this panel without a DSH restart;
 * - the retry subscription lives inside the injected declaration's lifetime,
 *   so fiber unload and declaration collapse both release it.
 *
 * The panel deliberately keeps the default priority rather than picking a
 * distinct one: entries sharing a cell at DIFFERENT priorities coexist on the
 * ledger but only the lowest renders, which would replace a loud collision
 * with a silent shadowing of the other plugin.
 *
 * The shared tree has no client-SDK dependency, so this module reads its
 * context through the structural shape below; callers pass the plugin's own
 * `ctx`.
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-model-capabilities/client/provider-card-seat
