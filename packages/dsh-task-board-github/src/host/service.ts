/**
 * GitHub synchronization engine for the task board's GitHub extension.

 * The engine never touches the Host ledger: it reads and writes every card
 * through the extension capability face the board hands it, so the board stays
 * the single authority and this provider owns only its own payload, its
 * identity index, and its outbound HTTP.
 *
 * The identity index is the provider's own structure: it is built from the
 * board's cards at start(), kept current as cards are materialized, and pruned
 * when the board reports a deletion. A lookup that misses rebuilds the index
 * from the board rather than trusting the cache blindly, so a card that
 * arrived out of band (a legacy ledger import, for instance) is still found.
